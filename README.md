# Giving React a Voice

## Abstract
"Alexa, what's new at React Rally?" From newsbriefings to games to smart-home integrations, it's no wonder that Amazon's voice service has quickly become a household name. And with the Alexa Skills Kit, building a skill couldn't be easier. Or could it? As a React developer, I wondered could it be possible to leverage the power and simplicity of React to create Alexa Skills? Find out what I discovered.

## Details
I'm going to build a custom React renderer that lets developers define an Alexa Skill using React and JSX. It will use the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js under the hood. In this talk I'll open with some history on the progression of voice technologies. This will incorporate how art has inspired/predicted tech. (Think Dick Tracy (watch), Knight Rider (KITT), Iron Man (Jarvis), etc.) Then I'll demo the custom renderer showing how to build a simple Skill including handling voice intents and displaying a card on the device screen. If the wifi gods are in a good mood I'll be able to test the skill live using Amazon's Alexa simulator. Otherwise I'll have a pre-recorded demonstration video.

## Pitch
When I first got an Amazon Echo I knew immediately that I wanted to build a skill for it. So I came up with an idea, researched how to code up a skill in JS and got to work. (At the time, the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js was still in its infancy.) When I was finally done, I enabled the skill on my Echo and as my son called out, "Alexa, ask the lunch lady what's for lunch?", I eagerly awaited her reply. Alexa responded in turn, spouting off the items on the school lunch menu for that day as I marvelled at what I had built.

Fast forward to today, the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js is officially released and makes building Skills super easy. But being a React developer I wanted to explore the idea of building a Skill using React. With projects like redocx and react-slack-renderer as references, I'll be able to build the Alexa renderer.

I'm a huge fan of voice technologies and how far they've come. The way we use our voices to interact with each other every day is a natural part of life. I believe using our voices to interact with technology is slowly becoming just as natural. Whether it's saying "I'm home" to turn on the house lights or "it's TV time" to lower the shades and settle in to watch a movie, I often think to myself, "we live in the future." And I think we as developers need to understand the importance in building this future and in exploring new ways to open up the experience to more of the community.

This talk would be my first conference talk which is both terrifying and exciting. I sat in the audience at last year's conference and came away feeling incredibly inspired. It made me want to get more involved in the community and push myself to try new things. I decided this year I want to pay it forward and hopefully inspire someone else to do the same.
